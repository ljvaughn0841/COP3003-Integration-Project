# COP3003-Integration-Project

This project is a productivity mobile app I am developing for an assignment in my COP 3003 class.
I'll be building this application over the course of the semester in C++.
I have some experience in C++ but am still very much a beginer especially so when it comes to moblie apps of which I have never dabbled in before.
The reason I'm making a productivity app for the assignment is because I've been in a bit of a slump lately and I think I have a few good ideas to increase my productivity.
