# COP3003-Integration-Project

This project is a productivity app in Qt I am developing for an assignment in my COP 3003 class.
I was originally planing on making this a mobile app so that I could have it on my iphone but I don't own a mac which makes developing an app for IOS difficult. I figured in Qt I could probably update it to be compatible with IOS if I ever get my hands one one. But for now this is just an app for the PC.
I'll be building this application over the course of the semester in C++.
I have some experience in C++ but am still very much a beginer especially so when it comes to apps in Qt of which I have never dabbled in before.
The reason I'm making a productivity app for the assignment is because I've been in a bit of a slump lately and I think I have a few good ideas to increase my productivity.
